# Hello_World

Hello!

My name is Wyatt, I am an introductory software developer training on Python by book and free code camp for html, java and their other platforms.
I particularly so far am enjoying the versatility of Python as a language and community and decided if I wanted to be a part of that community then this community would also be beneficial to my growth and development.
